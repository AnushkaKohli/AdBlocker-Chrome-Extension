// The chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener() method is used to intercept and cancel requests from the browser. It sets up an event listener that triggers before each network request is made. 
// This method takes three arguments:
// 1. A callback function that will be called when the event is triggered. It can return an object with a cancel property set to true to cancel the request.
// 2. An object that defines the URL patterns to match against.
// 3. An array of extra options to pass to the listener. In this case, weâ€™re using the blocking option to indicate that the request should be blocked.
// chrome.webRequest.onBeforeRequest.addListener(
//     function (details){
//         return {cancel: true};
//     },
//     {urls: defaultFilters},
//     ["blocking"]
